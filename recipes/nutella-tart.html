        <ol>
          <li>
            Cream together softened butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, add in salt, egg and vanilla before mixing well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sift the flour and milk powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, fold in the dry ingredients into the mixture containing the well-mixed butter, sugar and egg yolk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once completed, refrigerate the batter for 25 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 160 degrees C (or 325F).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, flour a clean surface and roll out the dough until about 0.5cm thickness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a cookie cutter, cut out the dough and transfer to baking tray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for about 12min 45 to 13min 45s or until it is starting to brown on the edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave to cool for about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, pipe your Nutella filling over the cookie. These filling will not expand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake an additional 8-10 minutes at 140 degrees C. If it cracks or bubbles, lower the temperature to 120C â€“ 130C.
          </li>
